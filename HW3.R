# My hypothesis is that people who have children got the vaccine more than people who don't have children. In addition, people who have children also went to restaurants less.
# I split the tables into KIDS_LT5Y, KIDS_5_11Y, KIDS_12_17Y, and people who don't have children to compare the proportion.

# 77.7 % of people who have children under 5 got the vaccine. 
# 79.2 % of people who have children 5 - 11 years old got the vaccine. 
# 80.2 % of people who have children 12 - 17 years old got the vaccine. 
# 90.1 % of people who don't have children got the vaccine. 

#In conclusion, having young children does not motivate people to get the vaccine. Age is a stronger factor.
